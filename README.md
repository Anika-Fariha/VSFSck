# VSFSck
In this project, a file system consistency checker, vsfsck, for a  custom virtual file system (VSFS) has been implemented. The tool is responsible for verifying the integrity and consistency of essential file system structures, including: 
● Superblock 
● Inodes 
● Data blocks 
● Inode and data bitmaps 
The checker will operate on a file system image (vsfs.img), identifying and reporting any inconsistencies found.
